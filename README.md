This is a modified code of [Juicebox version 1.22](https://github.com/aidenlab/Juicebox/tree/1.22) to compile **Juicer tools (v1.22)** with **CUDA (v10.0)**. \
\
[CUDA Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/mdivr/cuda-10.0) in combination with this code is used for compiling jar files.
Modification in the code was done based on this [google groups thread (Owen Chapman's comment)](https://groups.google.com/g/3d-genomics/c/JT3yqEJWfdo/m/lxX1zxaiBwAJ). \
\
**Jar files** are available in [this repository](https://github.com/m-mahgoub/juicer_tools)
